.SH NAME
_printf \- formats and prints data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a format string.
It writes output to the standard output stream (stdout).

The format string is composed of ordinary characters, which are copied
unchanged to the output, and conversion specifications introduced by
the '%' character. Each conversion specification results in fetching
one or more subsequent arguments and replacing the directive with the
appropriate output.

Internally, the implementation uses several helper functions:
.TP
.B _putchar
Writes a single character to stdout using the system call write(2).
.TP
.B print_c
Handles the %c specifier by printing a character.
.TP
.B print_s
Handles the %s specifier by printing a string.
.TP
.B print_int
Handles the %i specifier by printing an integer.
.TP
.B print_dec
Handles the %d specifier by printing a decimal number.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
A conversion specifier is a character that specifies the type of
conversion to be applied to the corresponding argument.

The supported conversion specifiers in this implementation are:

.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on
the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

.TP
.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting
character is written.

.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to a string of
characters. Characters from the string are written until a terminating
null byte ('\0') is encountered. If the argument is NULL, the string
"(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %
A literal '%' character is written. No argument is converted.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The _printf function prints the output to stdout and returns
the number of characters actually printed.
On error, it returns \-1.
.SH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The _printf function parses the format string character by character.

- Ordinary characters are sent directly to _putchar and printed.
- When a '%' is encountered, the function checks the next character:
  * "%%" prints a literal '%' character.
  * "c" calls print_c to print a character.
  * "s" calls print_s to print a string.
  * "S" calls print_S to print a string with non-printable characters handled.
  * "d" calls print_dec to print a decimal integer.
  * "i" calls print_int to print a signed integer.
- If no matching specifier is found, a '%' is printed as a literal.

The function maintains a counter of all characters printed. This counter
is returned to the caller as the function's return value.

The flow of execution in _printf can be visualized as follows:
